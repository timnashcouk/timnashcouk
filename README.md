I talk (A lot) about WordPress and security as well as subjects like performance and system administration at events, on [twitter](https://twitter.com/tnash) and even the occasional article on 🏠 [Tim Nash](https://timnash.co.uk).

I work as the platform lead for [34SP.com Managed WordPress Hosting](https://www.34sp.com).

My Github profile, mainly consists of my personal side projects.
